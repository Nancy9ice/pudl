EIA Form EIA-861 (and the short form EIA-861S) make up the Annual Electric Power Industry Report.
This survey is a census of all U.S. electric utilities and collects information about retail
sales of electricity and associated revenue on an annual basis.


As of 2023, the EIA-861 Form is organized into the following schedules:

* **Schedule 1:** Identification
* **Schedule 2:** Energy Sources data
* **Schedule 3:** Distribution information
* **Schedule 4:** Sales data
* **Schedule 5:** Mergers and/or Acquisition information
* **Schedule 6:** Demand-side Management Information
* **Schedule 7:** Net-Metering Programs Information
* **Schedule 8:** Service Territory Information

There are more than 20 different spreadsheets included in the annual zipfiles. For
details, see the `official EIA-861 page <{{ source.path }}>`__

{% block availability %}
PUDL incorporates all available EIA-861 data (except the 2019 data) dating back to 2001.
Earlier data from the forms EIA-861 (utility, Sales to Ultimate Customers, and Operational data),
and EIA-861S (Sales to Ultimate Customers) exists for the years 1990-2000, but is not yet included in PUDL.
As of 2023, PUDL only incorporates the annual data, but there's also a less detailed
monthly `Form EIA-861M <https: //www.eia.gov/electricity/data/eia861m />`__.

{% block respondents %}
The Form EIA-861 must be completed by electric power industry entities such as, but not limited to,
electric utilities, all Demand Side Management (DSM) Program Managers (entities responsible for
conducting or administering a DSM program), wholesale power marketers, energy service providers,
electric power producers, transmission owners, transmission operators, and Third Party Owners of
solar PV (TPO). Responses are collected at the operating company level (not at the holding company level).
EIA-861S is intended for smaller bundled-service utilities and requires less detailed responses.

EIA-861 and EIA-861S forms focus on annual data collection.
However, respondents respond to either Form EIA-861 or Form EIA-861S and never both.

{% block original_data %}
EIA typically publishes 861 data from the prior year in two rounds: an early release in the summer and a final release in the fall.
The data are published on the EIA website and distributed as a collection of spreadsheets.
The content of the spreadsheets varies from year to year as the questions in the form are updated.
EIA also periodically changes the naming and structure of the spreadsheets without warning.
Older “final” data may also be revised several years after it was published.
To ensure reproducible analyses, we archive `versioned snapshots of the EIA-861 data on Zenodo <https://zenodo.org/records/10204708>`__.
These archives are periodically refreshed with new data from the `EIA website <{{ source.path }}>`__.

To understand the details of how the form and data have evolved over time,
we recommend reading the Form Instructions from different years, linked above.

{% block notable_irregularities %}
* In 2012-2013 the EIA-861 was overhauled. Several tables were discontinued, and many
  more were added. Similar kinds of information reported in the two regimes may not be
  directly comparable.
* Most of the EIA-861 data that's available in the PUDL DB has not yet been fully
  normalized, meaning it contains many duplicate copies of the same information, which
  may not always be internally consistent.
* We also have not yet integrated the Balancing Authority and Utility IDs reported in
  the EIA-861 into our entity tables, so for the moment we don't have any foreign key
  constraints enabled on the EIA-861 tables.
* We have not yet integrated the 2018 EIA-861S data. Details about this are
  mentioned in issue :issue:`3654`
